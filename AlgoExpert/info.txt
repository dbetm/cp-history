Only proposal of algorithms are written if they are better than my own solution.


Note: 
In some codes, when using a list as a queue, I'm assuming that ops like queue.pop(0)
are constant time, but you know that under the hood it's a linear operation. Using a 
linked list could be the right thing (or in-built library), but a list was used by
simplicity.
