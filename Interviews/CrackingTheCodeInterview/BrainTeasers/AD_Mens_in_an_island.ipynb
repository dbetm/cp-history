    "- What is not clear is the question about \"how long does it take\", it's referring to time, but we don't know any measure of time to remove the hat, so there's a trick: Either all the people have a hat or no one...maybe. Also we can refer a symbolic answer like: \"it takes X people dunking on water\". "
