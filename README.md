My - competitive programming - history

I love a lot the problem solving, learn about data structures and algorithms. I had a first interest in competitive programming just before the university (2016). In 2017 I started to practice with problems in HackerRank and OmegaUp, then in 2018 I was beginner participant at competitive programming contests (official contests like ACM-ICPC and CodeJam). In this repository also I have technical interview practice exercises.
